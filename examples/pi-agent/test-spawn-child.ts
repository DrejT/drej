/**
 * Master/child agent test — verifies that a Pi agent can spawn and drive its
 * OWN child sandboxes from inside its own container, using OpenSandbox's
 * official `osb` CLI (installed as a setup step) invoked through Pi's bash
 * tool. No new drej/OpenSandbox code is needed for this to work — it's a
 * capability check on the existing platform, not a new feature.
 *
 * This requires the OpenSandbox server to be reachable *from inside a
 * container*, which is a different, harder problem than reachable from the
 * host. Two things have to be true:
 *
 *   1. The server must bind 0.0.0.0, not 127.0.0.1. A loopback-only bind
 *      (the default in `~/.sandbox.toml`'s example config) is unreachable
 *      from any container regardless of egress policy — confirmed by
 *      direct test, not documentation.
 *   2. The master agent needs a routable address for the server, not
 *      "localhost"/"127.0.0.1" (same bug class fixed elsewhere in this repo
 *      for host<->client connections, one network hop further out). For
 *      `uvx opensandbox-server` on the host with Docker's default `bridge`
 *      network, that's the bridge gateway IP — find it with:
 *        docker network inspect bridge --format '{{json .IPAM.Config}}'
 *      Override via MASTER_AGENT_OPENSANDBOX_DOMAIN if yours differs.
 *
 * Run:  bun examples/pi-agent/test-spawn-child.ts
 * Needs: OpenSandbox running + reachable from containers (see above),
 *        GEMINI_API_KEY in .env
 *
 * Expected output:
 *   - Pi runs `osb sandbox create`, `osb command run`, `osb sandbox kill`
 *     against a brand new sibling sandbox, entirely through its bash tool.
 *   - Independently verified from the host via the raw OpenSandbox API
 *     (not drej's own ledger, which never sees a sandbox created this way)
 *     that a new sandbox existed during the run.

You have the "osb" CLI installed (OpenSandbox's own CLI) and OPEN_SANDBOX_DOMAIN is already
set in your environment. Do the following using bash, step by step, and tell me what happened
at each step:

1. Run "osb sandbox create --image python:3.12-slim --timeout 5m -o json" to create a NEW
   sandbox (a sibling to your own, not inside your own container). If it fails to connect,
   run "osb config show -o json" to debug, and try "osb --protocol http sandbox create ..."
   explicitly.
2. Extract the new sandbox's ID from the JSON output.
3. Run a command inside that new sandbox with:
   osb command run <id> -o raw -- python3 -c "print(2 + 2)"
   and report its exact output.
4. Kill the sandbox you created with "osb sandbox kill <id>".

Report the child sandbox's ID and the exact output of the command you ran inside it.
