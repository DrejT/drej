   * inside its own turn). Going through `resume()` there would `pkill` the bridge
   * that's currently running the Pi process making the call — self-destructive.
   *
   * The returned `Agent` has no bridge, so `.prompt()`/`.bash()`/etc. all throw.
   * Its env is read back from `/etc/drej-env` on the sandbox itself (the ground
   * truth for what's actually running there) rather than re-derived from a spec
   * file, which may not even exist inside this particular sandbox.
   *

   * container — sibling-to-sibling traffic works fine, only this exact
   * self-connect case doesn't, and the caller already has the file locally.
   *
   * `opts.resources` sizes a subsequent `.spawn()`'s forked container — the
   * control API doesn't echo back a running sandbox's own resource limits, so
   * there's no way to discover this agent's *actual* footprint here. Defaults to
