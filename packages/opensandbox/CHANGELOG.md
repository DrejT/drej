# @drej/opensandbox

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- cc5059a: Cancel the exec/code SSE stream as soon as the terminal event (`execution_complete` or `error`) arrives instead of reading until the server closes the connection. execd holds the HTTP stream open for a fixed interval after sending its last event, so every `exec()`/`execCode()`/session command was paying that delay on top of the real round trip — this cuts steady-state exec latency from roughly 1 second to tens of milliseconds.

  Also switch the fixed-interval polling in `waitForRunning`, `waitForSnapshot`, and `resolveExecClient` to start fast and back off toward the original interval, instead of sleeping the full interval on every tick regardless of how quickly the real state change lands. Measured against a local OpenSandbox server, this cut checkpoint latency from ~2s to ~300-500ms.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fa18120: Add `sb.exec(cmd, { interactive: true })` for live, bidirectional PTY sessions — human-in-the-loop CLI access inside a sandbox. Returns an `InteractiveExecHandle` with `write()`, `resize()`, `signal()`, `close()`, and `attach()` in addition to the usual `stdout()`/`pipe()`/`result()`/`await` surface.

  Every `write()` is logged to the ledger alongside output, so a session still open at the last checkpoint is reconstructed on resume by replaying its recorded stdin for real against the freshly restored filesystem (OpenSandbox snapshots are rootfs-only — the original process is gone after resume, so this is the only way to re-derive shell state like exported vars or `cd`s).

  `@drej/opensandbox` gains a `PtyClient` wrapping execd's `/pty` REST + WebSocket protocol.

### Patch Changes

- b2d7096: Fix `ControlClient.listSandboxes()` and `listSnapshots()` returning the raw `{ items: [...] }` pagination envelope instead of a bare array — the declared return type was `Sandbox[]`/`Snapshot[]` but the methods never unwrapped `.items`, so `result.length` was `undefined` and array methods threw. Neither method had a caller anywhere else in the codebase, so this was previously untested dead code; surfaced by `examples/pi-agent/test-spawn-child.ts`, which uses `listSandboxes()` directly against the live OpenSandbox API.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- a4856f1: Fix every published package that depends on a sibling workspace package shipping a literal `"workspace:*"` version string instead of a real semver range.

  `changeset publish` always shells out to plain `npm publish`, which has no concept of the `workspace:` protocol — unlike `bun publish`/`pnpm publish`, which resolve it automatically. Every currently published version of `drej`, `@drej/agent`, `@drej/workflow`, and `drejx` has `"workspace:*"` in its `dependencies`, which `npm install` cannot resolve at all (`EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL`). Installing any of these packages from npm fails outright.

  Added `scripts/resolve-workspace-protocol.ts`, run in CI immediately before `npm publish`, which rewrites every `workspace:*`/`workspace:^`/`workspace:~` dependency range to the corresponding package's already-resolved version before the tarball is packed.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- a91651c: Fix npm publish failures and a broken `drejx` CLI build:

  - Add the missing `repository` field to every published package's `package.json`. Without it, npm rejects publishes with `provenance: true` enabled (added previously) — every package failed to publish with a 422 "Error verifying sigstore provenance bundle" (see the last "Version Packages" release run).
  - Add `packages/cli` to the root `build` script. It was never built by CI before publish, so every previously-published `drejx` version (up to and including 0.2.1 on npm) shipped with no `dist/` folder at all — the CLI has never actually worked when installed from npm.
  - Remove a duplicate shebang in `packages/cli/tsdown.config.ts`'s `banner` config (the source file already has its own `#!/usr/bin/env bun`), which produced a syntactically broken `dist/index.mjs` whenever the package _was_ built manually.
  - Add `packages/agent` and `packages/cli` to the root `typecheck` script — both were previously only checked ad hoc.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 34cfa8b: Add the missing `license` field (Apache-2.0) to every published package's `package.json`, matching the repo's root `LICENSE` file.
- 3f362d1: Enable npm provenance for published packages.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c81c77d: Sandbox API extensions: `pause()` / `resume()`, `createSession()` / `BashSession` persistent shell sessions, `diagnosticLogs()` / `diagnosticEvents()`, `watchMetrics()` streaming, and `Drej.connect()` for attaching to an already-running container. Agent: `Agent.resume(sandboxId)` to reconnect a new host process to a live agent sandbox (restarts the bridge with `--continue`).

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 10417e3: feat: add drejx CLI with Docker-based OpenSandbox init and registry support; add useServerProxy option to Drej client

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 0d94c2a: Add per-step timeout and AbortSignal cancellation

  **Per-step timeouts**: steps now accept `timeoutMs` to cap execution time. A
  global fallback can be set via `RunOptions.stepTimeoutMs`. When exceeded, the
  step fails with `StepTimeoutError` and rollback runs automatically.

  **Cancellation**: `WorkflowRun.cancel()` aborts the run immediately. Breaking
  out of the `for await` loop does the same. Pass `RunOptions.signal` to wire in
  an external `AbortController` or `AbortSignal.timeout()`.

  Both features share the same internal mechanism: a per-step `AbortController`
  scoped to both `ControlClient` and `ExecClient` via `withSignal()`, so
  in-flight HTTP calls and SSE exec streams are cancelled cleanly at the fetch
  level. Rollback still runs with unscoped clients to ensure cleanup always
  completes.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- b04f8eb: Add `execCode()` to the workflow builder and expose exit code in workflow state.

  `SandboxStepBuilder.execCode()` lets you run code directly (Python, Node.js, etc.)
  via execd's code interpreter — with optional stateful context to share variables
  across calls. Previously only shell commands (`exec()`) were available in the builder.

  `exec()` now captures the command exit code from the SSE stream and sets
  `exitCode` on workflow state after each step. This makes `when({ field: "exitCode" })`
  predicates actually useful for branching on command success or failure.

  `CodeContext` is now exported from the `drej` package for consumers who want to
  type context options explicitly.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0ea4c33: Rename npm scope from `@drej/*` to `@drej/*` and add TSDoc to all public API surfaces.

  - All workspace packages now published under `@drej/*` (e.g. `@drej/sqlite`, `@drej/postgres`)
  - `DrejClient`, `WorkflowBuilder`, `SandboxStepBuilder`, `IStorageAdapter`, `LedgerEvent`, `SandboxOpts` and all their members now have hover documentation visible in VS Code

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d77498: Bundle SDK, publish workspace packages publicly, and make adapter required.

  - `@drej/core` and `@drej/opensandbox` are now published public packages (previously private workspace-only)
  - `drej` SDK ships a pre-built `dist/` with a bundled ESM JS file and TypeScript declarations; `"main"` now points to `./dist/index.js`
  - `WorkflowDeps.ledger` field renamed to `WorkflowDeps.adapter`
  - `DrejClientOptions.adapter` is now **required** — callers must supply a storage adapter (`@drej/sqlite`, `@drej/postgres`, or a custom `IStorageAdapter`)
  - `MemoryAdapter`, `NdjsonAdapter`, and the `ledgerDir` shorthand have been removed; drej has no built-in storage opinion
  - Root `build` script added: generates declarations for workspace packages then runs tsup for the SDK
